        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> Hi, I’m Divyansh Agarwal(you can call me Div), a Computer Science graduate from NYU with a focus on AI, machine learning, and data systems.
	I’ve built deep learning pipelines for neurological data, deployed LLM-based automation in industry, and developed efficient models for real-time systems. My work spans across research, startups, and cross-functional tech teams, blending algorithmic rigor with practical deployment. I care deeply about building scalable, production-ready tools that solve real problems—whether that’s detecting neural spikes, automating content workflows, or accelerating scientific computing.</p>

                <p>Sep 2024</p>
                <p> Currently, in this role, I focus on the challenging and iterative problem of defining and detecting events in voltage imaging data that reflect neural activity in the brain. We collaborate closely with neuroscientists and researchers at the Losonczy Lab at Columbia University to establish ground truth labels. Using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we work to identify distinct event types, uncover underlying patterns, and develop methods to accurately detect these events while distinguishing them from noise. </p>

	  <h2>Personal</h2>
	    <p>I’m someone who finds joy in the little things—taking long walks in nature, discovering new experiences, and spending hours wandering through museums. I’m always on the lookout for inspiration, whether it’s in a new place, a great film, or a quiet moment.</p>
		<p>Music is a huge part of my life. I’ve been exploring classical music recently and absolutely love the experience of live orchestral performances. My current playlist features a mix of rock and progressive sounds, including <em>Money for Nothing</em> by Dire Straits, <em>Alive</em> by Pearl Jam, <em>Drive Home</em> by Steven Wilson, and <em>Pigs (Three Different Ones)</em> by Pink Floyd.</p>
		<p>When I’m not listening to music, you’ll likely find me cooking something new or writing—though I tend to keep my writing to myself for now.</p>
