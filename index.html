        <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Divyansh Agarwal—most people call me Div. I'm a Computer Science graduate from NYU with a deep interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the systems that power modern computing. My experience spans academic research, startup innovation, and collaborative engineering environments, where I’ve worked on everything from low-level data pipelines to high-level intelligent systems.</p>

<p>My work sits at the intersection of theory and implementation—whether it's designing models to interpret neurological signals, optimizing systems for real-time performance, or exploring how large language models can reshape automation and scientific workflows. I enjoy tackling problems that require both technical depth and creative thinking, and I’m especially drawn to challenges that push the boundaries of what machines can learn and how they can assist human progress.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting parts of being a technologist today is the speed at which we can learn and build. I actively use AI-powered tools—like AI CLIs and AI-driven development environments—not just to accelerate development, but as a way to explore new domains, test ideas quickly, and close skill gaps in real time. This blend of curiosity and computational thinking is how I stay engaged, adaptive, and excited about what’s next.</p>

                <p> Currently, in this role, I focus on the challenging and iterative problem of defining and detecting events in voltage imaging data that reflect neural activity in the brain. We collaborate closely with neuroscientists and researchers at the Losonczy Lab at Columbia University to establish ground truth labels. Using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we work to identify distinct event types, uncover underlying patterns, and develop methods to accurately detect these events while distinguishing them from noise. </p>

            <h3>Expert-Call RAG Assistant</h3>
            <p>This project is a locally-run Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to query a collection of expert-call transcripts. The system uses a large language model to generate answers based on the most relevant retrieved text chunks and provides citations to the original source document and page number. This ensures that the answers are grounded in the provided context, reducing hallucinations and improving trust in the output. The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy replacement of components such as the language model or the retrieval system. The primary technologies used were <strong>Python</strong>, with libraries such as <strong>Gradio</strong> for the web interface, <strong>LanceDB</strong> for the vector store, and <strong>LlamaIndex</strong> for orchestrating the RAG pipeline. The system uses a quantized <strong>Llama-3.1-8B</strong> model for local inference, <strong>Sentence-Transformers</strong> for embedding and re-ranking, and <strong>PyMuPDF</strong> for PDF text extraction.</p>

            <h3>Cloud-Native Social Media Automation System</h3>
            <p>Developed a fully serverless pipeline on AWS to automate social media image posting using Google Photos, chatbot input, and AI-generated captions. The system fetches daily photos, analyzes them with AWS Rekognition, indexes them in OpenSearch, and overlays AI-generated captions using Claude 3 (via Bedrock). Leveraged services include Lambda, Cognito, Lex, SQS, S3, API Gateway, Secrets Manager, OpenSearch, and ElastiCache for scalable, secure, and personalized content creation and posting to platforms like Bluesky.</p>

            <p>Participated in a Kaggle competition to fine-tune Llama 3.1-8B for verifying the correctness of answers to math questions. Achieved 0.85 accuracy using supervised fine-tuning with LoRA adapters, prompt engineering, and hyperparameter optimization. Created custom unbiased datasets, employed ensemble strategies, and experimented with advanced configurations (e.g., gradient accumulation, Flash Attention, and LoRA rank tuning). This project demonstrated efficient large-model adaptation for reasoning tasks.</p>

            <p>This project involved building a large-scale, embedding-based recommendation system for music using the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset. We generated vector embeddings for songs, playlists, and lyrics using Word2Vec, stored them in MongoDB and ChromaDB, and used cosine similarity and k-NN for similarity search. Apache Spark powered scalable data processing, and PCA-based visualization revealed meaningful song clusters, enhancing recommendation quality.</p>

            <p>This project aims to make understanding complex world economics and trade data easier through interactive visualizations. Using the OECD Quarterly International Trade Statistics dataset, this project provides multiple perspectives on international trade through network maps and geo-spatial data. The visualizations are interactive, allowing users to explore trade data for specific regions and filter by various parameters. [cite_start]The primary technologies used were <strong>Python</strong>, with libraries such as <strong>Streamlit</strong> for the web application, <strong>Pandas</strong> for data cleaning and manipulation, and <strong>NetworkX</strong>, <strong>Plotly</strong>, and <strong>Altair</strong> for creating the different data visualizations like radial network maps, geo-spatial maps, and matrix maps.</p>

            <h3>In-Context Learning with GPT-4 on Pokémon Showdown</h3>
            <p>Explored the strategic capabilities of GPT-4 within the competitive environment of Pokémon Showdown. 
            This project involved prompting GPT-4 to generate teams and make decisions based on varying levels 
            of game context — from general meta-data to opponent-specific battle logs. The system showed increased 
            win rates with personalized context, particularly against less experienced players, while struggling 
            against expert strategies. Technologies used include Python, GPT-4, PokeLLMon, and Pikalytics, web scraping.</p>

  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>I’m someone who finds joy in the little things—taking long walks in nature, discovering new experiences, and spending hours wandering through museums. I’m always on the lookout for inspiration, whether it’s in a new place, a great film, or a quiet moment.</p>
  
  <p>Music is a huge part of my life. I’ve recently been exploring classical music and especially love the immersive experience of live orchestral performances. My current playlist is a mix of rock and progressive sounds, including <em>Money for Nothing</em> by Dire Straits, <em>Alive</em> by Pearl Jam, <em>Drive Home</em> by Steven Wilson, and <em>Pigs (Three Different Ones)</em> by Pink Floyd.</p>
  
  <p>When I’m not listening to music, you’ll likely find me experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes or writing—though I tend to keep my writing to myself for now.</p>
  
  <p>I’ve also developed a deep appreciation for reading, particularly fiction, classic literature, and philosophy. I’m currently making my way through Dostoevsky’s <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, with <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> and <em>White Nights</em> on deck. Recently, I finished Tolstoy’s <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> and Kafka’s <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, and I’ve also started Hesse’s <em>Siddhartha</em>. I once tried reading the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>—a profound work, though I’ll admit it felt a bit beyond me at the time!</p>
