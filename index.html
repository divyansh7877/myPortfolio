        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> Hi, I’m Divyansh Agarwal(you can call me Div), a Computer Science graduate from NYU with a focus on AI, machine learning, and data systems. I’ve built deep learning pipelines for neurological data, deployed LLM-based automation in industry, and developed efficient models for real-time systems. My work spans across research, startups, and cross-functional tech teams, blending algorithmic rigor with practical deployment. I care deeply about building scalable, production-ready tools that solve real problems—whether that’s detecting neural spikes, automating content workflows, or accelerating scientific computing.</p>

            <h3>Expert-Call RAG Assistant</h3>
            <p>This project is a locally-run Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to query a collection of expert-call transcripts. The system uses a large language model to generate answers based on the most relevant retrieved text chunks and provides citations to the original source document and page number. This ensures that the answers are grounded in the provided context, reducing hallucinations and improving trust in the output. The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy replacement of components such as the language model or the retrieval system. The primary technologies used were <strong>Python</strong>, with libraries such as <strong>Gradio</strong> for the web interface, <strong>LanceDB</strong> for the vector store, and <strong>LlamaIndex</strong> for orchestrating the RAG pipeline. The system uses a quantized <strong>Llama-3.1-8B</strong> model for local inference, <strong>Sentence-Transformers</strong> for embedding and re-ranking, and <strong>PyMuPDF</strong> for PDF text extraction.</p>

            <h3>Cloud-Native Social Media Automation System</h3>
            <p>Developed a fully serverless pipeline on AWS to automate social media image posting using Google Photos, chatbot input, and AI-generated captions. The system fetches daily photos, analyzes them with AWS Rekognition, indexes them in OpenSearch, and overlays AI-generated captions using Claude 3 (via Bedrock). Leveraged services include Lambda, Cognito, Lex, SQS, S3, API Gateway, Secrets Manager, OpenSearch, and ElastiCache for scalable, secure, and personalized content creation and posting to platforms like Bluesky.</p>

            <h3>Fine-Tuning Llama 3.1-8B for Math Answer Verification</h3>
            <p>Participated in a Kaggle competition to fine-tune Llama 3.1-8B for verifying the correctness of answers to math questions. Achieved 0.85 accuracy using supervised fine-tuning with LoRA adapters, prompt engineering, and hyperparameter optimization. Created custom unbiased datasets, employed ensemble strategies, and experimented with advanced configurations (e.g., gradient accumulation, Flash Attention, and LoRA rank tuning). This project demonstrated efficient large-model adaptation for reasoning tasks.</p>

            <h3>Scalable Vector Search for Music Recommendations</h3>
            <p>This project involved building a large-scale, embedding-based recommendation system for music using the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset. We generated vector embeddings for songs, playlists, and lyrics using Word2Vec, stored them in MongoDB and ChromaDB, and used cosine similarity and k-NN for similarity search. Apache Spark powered scalable data processing, and PCA-based visualization revealed meaningful song clusters, enhancing recommendation quality.</p>

            <p>This project aims to make understanding complex world economics and trade data easier through interactive visualizations. Using the OECD Quarterly International Trade Statistics dataset, this project provides multiple perspectives on international trade through network maps and geo-spatial data. The visualizations are interactive, allowing users to explore trade data for specific regions and filter by various parameters. [cite_start]The primary technologies used were <strong>Python</strong>, with libraries such as <strong>Streamlit</strong> for the web application, <strong>Pandas</strong> for data cleaning and manipulation, and <strong>NetworkX</strong>, <strong>Plotly</strong>, and <strong>Altair</strong> for creating the different data visualizations like radial network maps, geo-spatial maps, and matrix maps.</p>

            <h3>In-Context Learning with GPT-4 on Pokémon Showdown</h3>
            <p>Explored the strategic capabilities of GPT-4 within the competitive environment of Pokémon Showdown. 
            This project involved prompting GPT-4 to generate teams and make decisions based on varying levels 
            of game context — from general meta-data to opponent-specific battle logs. The system showed increased 
            win rates with personalized context, particularly against less experienced players, while struggling 
            against expert strategies. Technologies used include Python, GPT-4, PokeLLMon, and Pikalytics, web scraping.</p>

	  <h2>Personal</h2>
	    <p>I’m someone who finds joy in the little things—taking long walks in nature, discovering new experiences, and spending hours wandering through museums. I’m always on the lookout for inspiration, whether it’s in a new place, a great film, or a quiet moment.</p>
		<p>Music is a huge part of my life. I’ve been exploring classical music recently and absolutely love the experience of live orchestral performances. My current playlist features a mix of rock and progressive sounds, including <em>Money for Nothing</em> by Dire Straits, <em>Alive</em> by Pearl Jam, <em>Drive Home</em> by Steven Wilson, and <em>Pigs (Three Different Ones)</em> by Pink Floyd.</p>
		<p>When I’m not listening to music, you’ll likely find me cooking something new or writing—though I tend to keep my writing to myself for now.</p>
