        <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Divyansh Agarwal—most people call me Div. I'm a Computer Science graduate from NYU with a deep interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the systems that power modern computing. My experience spans academic research, startup innovation, and collaborative engineering environments, where I’ve worked on everything from low-level data pipelines to high-level intelligent systems.</p>

<p>My work sits at the intersection of theory and implementation—whether it's designing models to interpret neurological signals, optimizing systems for real-time performance, or exploring how large language models can reshape automation and scientific workflows. I enjoy tackling problems that require both technical depth and creative thinking, and I’m especially drawn to challenges that push the boundaries of what machines can learn and how they can assist human progress.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting parts of being a technologist today is the speed at which we can learn and build. I actively use AI-powered tools—like AI CLIs and AI-driven development environments—not just to accelerate development, but as a way to explore new domains, test ideas quickly, and close skill gaps in real time. This blend of curiosity and computational thinking is how I stay engaged, adaptive, and excited about what’s next.</p>

                <p> Currently, in this role, I focus on the challenging and iterative problem of defining and detecting events in voltage imaging data that reflect neural activity in the brain. We collaborate closely with neuroscientists and researchers at the Losonczy Lab at Columbia University to establish ground truth labels. Using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we work to identify distinct event types, uncover underlying patterns, and develop methods to accurately detect these events while distinguishing them from noise. </p>

            <h3>Expert-Call RAG Assistant</h3>
            <p>This project is a locally-run Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to query a collection of expert-call transcripts. The system uses a large language model to generate answers based on the most relevant retrieved text chunks and provides citations to the original source document and page number. This ensures that the answers are grounded in the provided context, reducing hallucinations and improving trust in the output. The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy replacement of components such as the language model or the retrieval system. The primary technologies used were <strong>Python</strong>, with libraries such as <strong>Gradio</strong> for the web interface, <strong>LanceDB</strong> for the vector store, and <strong>LlamaIndex</strong> for orchestrating the RAG pipeline. The system uses a quantized <strong>Llama-3.1-8B</strong> model for local inference, <strong>Sentence-Transformers</strong> for embedding and re-ranking, and <strong>PyMuPDF</strong> for PDF text extraction.</p>

  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>I’m someone who finds joy in the little things—taking long walks in nature, discovering new experiences, and spending hours wandering through museums. I’m always on the lookout for inspiration, whether it’s in a new place, a great film, or a quiet moment.</p>
  
  <p>Music is a huge part of my life. I’ve recently been exploring classical music and especially love the immersive experience of live orchestral performances. My current playlist is a mix of rock and progressive sounds, including <em>Money for Nothing</em> by Dire Straits, <em>Alive</em> by Pearl Jam, <em>Drive Home</em> by Steven Wilson, and <em>Pigs (Three Different Ones)</em> by Pink Floyd.</p>
  
  <p>When I’m not listening to music, you’ll likely find me experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes or writing—though I tend to keep my writing to myself for now.</p>
  
  <p>I’ve also developed a deep appreciation for reading, particularly fiction, classic literature, and philosophy. I’m currently making my way through Dostoevsky’s <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, with <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> and <em>White Nights</em> on deck. Recently, I finished Tolstoy’s <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> and Kafka’s <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, and I’ve also started Hesse’s <em>Siddhartha</em>. I once tried reading the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>—a profound work, though I’ll admit it felt a bit beyond me at the time!</p>
